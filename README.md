Problem Statement: Defamation due to false news.

Introduction: Our app helps to detect if the news is fake or original by checking its credibility with reliable sources. This app creates a safe space for its users and has the potential to be nearly foolproof. Be it whatever field you follow- Bollywood, sports or the news ; we aspire to bring you nothing but the best.

Problem: Misinformation and disinformation — or fake news — can have damaging effects on a large number of people in a short time. Although the notion of fake news has existed well before technological advances, social media have exacerbated the problem.

Solution: AWARENESS AND MEDIA LITERACY WILL BE  RAISED AT CONSUMER LEVEL WITH AN EFFECT ON DATA PROTECTION.
